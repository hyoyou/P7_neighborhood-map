# Neighborhood Map React Application

This is a React App that uses 2 third party APIs to fetch and display data created for Project #7 of my Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program. I chose to display my favorite eateries at Universal Studios Orlando. The application implements use of responsive web design, accessibility through use of ARIA roles and labels, as well as a service worker for offline access of the app.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and navigate to the correct directory. Run `npm install && npm start` to run the development server. A browser should open, but in the case that it does not, navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
